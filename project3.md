## Project description

The Minimum Overlap Program is designed to take input as a text file containing mulitple groups of numbers, called sets. The program then finds the minimum overlap of how many sets must be chosen so that every number in the file is chosen at least once. The program also generates timing data to display the time taken to calculate the minimum overlap for any given set.

## How to compile and run the program

A makefile is included in the implementation of this project, which only requires the command "make" to compile the program. To run, use the command "make run", which also compiles the program again before running, if necessary. Other variations of make are included in the program's files, which are given sets for testing purposes, such as "make large30".

```bash
make
make run
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
