## Project description

The File Helper project is a program that maps integer IDs with a set of first names and last names. This map is designed to be used to store and access the collected data in a quick and efficient manner.

## How to compile and run the program

A makefile is included in the implementation of this project, which only requires the command "make" to compile the program. To run, use the command "make run", which also compiles the program again before running, if necessary.

```bash
make
make run
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.

The program is not inherently designed to accept user input, but can be easily adjusted to do so. The program's main function is to iterate through given text files

## 3. Additional Considerations
