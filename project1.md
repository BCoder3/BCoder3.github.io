## Project description

The File Helper project is a program that maps integer IDs with a set of first names and last names. This map is designed to be used to store and access the collected data in a quick and efficient manner.

## How to compile and run the program

A makefile is included in the implementation of this project, which only requires the command "make" to compile the program. To run, use the command "make run", which also compiles the program again before running, if necessary.

```bash
make
make run
```

## UI Design

The program is not inherently designed to accept user input, but can be adjusted to do so. The program's main function is to iterate through given text files and map each given first and last name to an integer id for easy storage and access.

## 3. Additional Considerations

This project includes the ability to manipulate stored data by way of addition of new data, and the removal of existing data.
