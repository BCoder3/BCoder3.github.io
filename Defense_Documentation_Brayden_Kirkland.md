# **1. Statement of Purpose**

People should act more rationally and think more logically when
looking at problems that can be solved within reason, and this can
be taught through the unassuming medium of a video game. Nearly
every day, I see the consequences of people, who should know better,
making illogical and irrational decisions.

I want to make people see the world in a different light; to be more
open and reasonable, to think logically, and I also want to entertain.
Through this mode of thinking, the world would be a kinder place, full
of empathy, compassion, and understanding, and this is the ideal state
of affairs.

My solution to this problem is the development of a video game. My
intention with this solution is to mold the minds of those who
experience it to solve the problem discussed above, and to have fun
learning.

# **2. Research and Background**

A great deal of personal research has gone into the development of
this video game, as I have had no prior knowledge on game-making
until beginning its development last year, and one class in high
school. I have yet to learn the most intricate techniques more
seasoned developers have utilized in the engine I have been building
with, Unreal Engine 5, but the base knowledge on the program I have
gathered thus far is indispensable. I have watched hours of
tutorials and beginner's guides to learn how best to use this
program and to create even further beyond what I am developing now
for this project.

# **3. Project Language(s), Software, and Hardware**

The development engine I am using for my project is Unreal Engine 5
(UE5), the fifth installment of a video game development system by
Epic Games. It utilizes a block-coding methodology for the majority
of the work done within it, but behind the scenes - and also
directly manipulatable - it runs on C++. In addition to the standard
libraries, packages, and assets found within the base UE5 studio, I
have gathered many assets used in my project from the Fab database,
an often-used plugin for UE5, all of which are licensing free.
Lastly, I am using GitHub for version control, since UE5 has a
partnership program alongside GitHub, with a built-in plugin
available for download. As for hardware, most modern computing
systems can at least moderately handle the development studio
itself, as I am using my personal computer to develop the project,
but there is no particular hardware required to run the game other
than a mouse, keyboard, and visual monitor on a computer device.

**Product**

- Product Name: Puzzle Heart Video Game

**Project Description**

Puzzle Heart is a video game that revolves around solving puzzles in a
procedurally generated, digital world. Its purpose is for entertainment
and to challenge the user\'s problem-solving abilities.

# **6. Test Plan**

The purpose of the Puzzle Heart video game study is to evaluate the
problem-solving skills required to complete the game, with every
playthrough being timed. Test users will be instructed to complete the
game to the best of their ability and as fast as they can. Test
operators will also be given a short survey to complete after their
experience for feedback purposes. For the test results included below,
testers tasked with completing two playthroughs of the game, both timed.
The second playthrough is to be done using the same seed as the first in
order to generate the same game map, and then the times of completion of
both of these playthroughs are compared, and user feedback is given.

**Features to be Tested**

The running state of the Puzzle Heart video game is the main feature to
be tested. Within this facet of the project there are many other
subfeatures to be tested, such as ensuring that the procedural
generation of the world does not hinder the flow of gameplay, and to
ensure that every puzzle is sovlable.

**Features Not to Be Tested**

The engine of the game\'s creation does not need to be tested in this
test plan.

**Unit Test Strategy / Extent of Unit Testing:**

Evaluate new features and bug fixes introduced in this release. (Specify
the properties of test environment: hardware, software, network etc.)

**Unit Test Cases**

| #  | OBJECTIVE             | INPUT             | EXPECTED RESULTS                          | TEST DELIVERABLES   |
|----|-----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------------|
| 1  | Check procedural generation | Procedural Generation code | Generated game world functions and map randomization | Playable game world |
| 2  | Check puzzle solvability | Puzzle coding + procedural generation | Generated puzzles can be solved | Game can be completed |
| 3  | Check player movement | W, A, S, and D keys press | Player avatar moves in desired direction | Player can move in desired direction |
| 4  | Check world interaction | E key press | Player interacts with object | Player can interact |
| 5  | Check camera movement | Mouse movement | Camera moves with mouse motion | Player can look around |
| 6  | Game can be run | Developer feature | Game runs without issue | Game runs |
| 7  | Game can be edited | Developer feature | Game can be edited without issue | Game can be edited |

**User-Acceptance Test**

In order to test for User-acceptance, users designated to test the
Puzzle Heart video game will be asked to complete the game at their own
pace, and will be timed from the start of their gameplay to their
completion of the game. This will be used to determine an average time
of completion on the game itself, and users will then be surveyed on
their experience of the game. This process will be repeated using the
same seed recreate the game world originally played on, and the
time-to-completion for both runs will be compared

**User-Acceptance Test Strategy**

The user will be informed of their goal to complete within the game, and
then start the game. The game will always be able to be completed, and
the only variables are the terrain that has been procedurally generated,
the puzzle minigames, and the seed of the world. A timer that will
record how long it takes for the user to complete the objective will be
displayed at all times during gameplay

**User-Acceptance Test Cases**

| #  | TEST ITEM              | EXPECTED RESULTS                          | ACTUAL RESULTS                          | DATE       |
|----|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|------------|
| 1  | User can finish game   | Game should be able to be completed       | Possible                                | 10/30/25   |
| 2  | Time taken for user to finish first game playthrough | Variable by tester, around 2–4 minutes   | Results vary. Around 3–4 minutes        | 11/20–23/25|
| 3  | Time taken for user to finish second game playthrough | Variable by tester, around 2–3 minutes, but shorter than tester’s first playthrough time | Results vary. Around 2–3 minutes. Vast majority made shorter times on second playthrough | 11/20–23/25|
| 4  | User provides feedback on experience | Variable by tester, expecting positive and constructive feedback | Testers gave ideas that were implemented into the final product in order to elevate the experience | 11/23/25   |

**Test Deliverables**

- Test Plan

- Test Scripts are to be determined

- Defect/Enhancement Logs are to be determined

- Test Result Reports are to be determined

**Schedule**

Bulk testing to be undertaken between 11/20-23/25

**Risks**

- Machine used to run the game for the intentions to complete the
  objectives of this test plan may be unfit in terms of hardware
  requirements for gameplay.

- In order to mitigate this risk, the game should be optimized to run on
  lower-hardware machines and the machine especially chosen to run the
  test cases should be fit if possible

# **8. Challenges Overcome**

I experienced some great obstacles in developing this video game,
especially due to my lack of experience using the engine and in ways
of how I wanted to design certain aspects of the project. I found
that there were many design implementations I wished to include in
the final product, but constraints such as time and lack of
technical knowledge of the system greatly inhibited my progress
along the way.

# **9. Future Enhancements**

In the future, I would like to expand on this project and even
create more projects within the Unreal Engine 5 system because video
games are my passion. I would love to learn more about the
intricacies and finer tunings of the software so that I can fully
implement my original design ideas to enhance the experience and
realize my visions.
