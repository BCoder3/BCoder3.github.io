-   **Class:** CSCI 315
-   **Grade:** B

## Project description

This project is designed to parse given HTML files, notify the user if the given file is balanced - meaning if it is fully semantically correct, or "balanced", or not, and also count and display how many other files the file can visit via url, and how many files that those found files can visit, and so on.

## How to compile and run the program

A makefile is included in the implementation of this project, which only requires the command "make" to compile the program. To run, use the command "make run", which also compiles the program again before running, if necessary.

```bash
make
make run
```

## UI Design

Almost every program requires user interaction, even command-line programs. Include in this section the tasks the user can complete and what the program does. You don't need to include how it works here; that information may go in the project description or in an additional section, depending on its significance.
